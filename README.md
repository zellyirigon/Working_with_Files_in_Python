# Working with Files in Python 📂

This repo has a simple Jupyter notebook where I played around with file handling in Python. Nothing fancy — just me learning how to create, read, write, and move files. 🛠️

## What You’ll Find Here 🔍

- Creating text and CSV files.
- Reading file content and looping through lines.
- Writing and appending data to files.
- Moving, renaming, and deleting files with `os` and `shutil`.

## Why It Matters 💡

Being able to handle files is a key skill for Data Analysts. Whether it's cleaning raw data, organizing datasets, or automating file processing, knowing how to work with files in Python makes life easier. 📊

## Just a Heads-Up ⚠️

This is just me learning stuff. Feel free to check it out, but it’s not some serious project. 😊
